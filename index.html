                        I am a clinician with over 12 years experience in the NHS and private sector. My main areas of interest are strategic planning and innovation with a particular emphasis on remote consultation and collaborative multi-disciplinary working. I am passionate about improving quality of healthcare both from a clinician and patient perspective by developing smart, efficient working strategies and utilising the latest in point of care testing, near patient monitoring and machine learning. In addition to clinical skills in primary care (including minor skin surgery) and emergency medicine, I am proficient in computer programming in Python and have basic HTML skills. I am well versed in the main GP patient management systems, Vision, EMIS, Adastra, Heydoc. Drawing the skills that I have developed in my career from quick, high pressured, decison making as a registrar in head and neck surgery, to calculated, investigative report writing as a registrar in pathology, I am able to adapt to the tasks at hand.
